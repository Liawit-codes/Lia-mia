<h1> Microbiology</h1>
<p id="introduction"> Today I am going to talk about <em>Microbiology</em>, a subject very near to my heart, as I studied it in the university and I worked as a microbiologist for over six years before I moved to the UK. <em>Microbiology is a study of microbes, such as <strong>bacteria, virus, parasites and fungi</strong></em>. What interests me most about the subject is that most of the procedures are manual that allows you to experience everything firsthand, for example, when you grow the bacteria in thier respective food and seeing them grow and multiply is a feeling that I can not describe.</p>

<p> My interest in microbiology stemmed from various aspects, such as the fascinating world of tiny organisms, their impact on health and the environment, and the potential for new <em>biotechnological applications</em>. Microorganisms influence our health and the environment, affecting everything starting infectious diseases around us.</p>
